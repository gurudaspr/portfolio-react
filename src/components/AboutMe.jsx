                Hello, I'm Gurudas Pr, a passionate student navigating the exhilarating world of web development.
                My focal point is mastering the MERN stackâ€”comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
                I thrive on the creative process, turning conceptual ideas into digital realities. Always curious, I continuously explore new skills,
                tools, and concepts, fostering a commitment to lifelong learning. Beyond solo full-stack projects, I've collaborated with creative teams,
                engaging in daily stand-ups, effective communication, and project management.
                Armed with a strong design understanding and meticulous attention to detail, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript, currently immersing myself in the complexities of the MERN stack for ongoing growth and innovation.</p>
